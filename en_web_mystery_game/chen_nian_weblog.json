In the end, the staff just gave me the answer... No way, when the game officially launches, I'm definitely going to spend all my time until I figure it out 💪",

Even if it's just a distant cousin, I'm still very grateful that there's someone who remembers me, responds, and cares.\n\nUncle, I hope everything goes smoothly for you and you stay healthy. Happy birthday!",
